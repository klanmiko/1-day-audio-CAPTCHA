Week 1 Meeting Notes
Group: 1-Day (Andrei Blebea, Kaelan Mikowicz, Kamal Sadek, Monisha Selvanayagam Ravindar)

Last week: Coming up with specific topics relating to audio CAPTCHAS and finalizing the specific domain that we will tackle, well as our game plan for the upcoming weeks.

This week: Working on an initial prototype of audio CAPTCHA outlined in paper. This should be able to somewhat reasonably differentiate a voice clip between a human speaker and a robot speaker.

Issues: Lack of previous work in area
