#Week 3 Meeting Notes
##Group: 1-Day (Andrei Blebea, Kaelan Mikowicz, Kamal Sadek, Monisha Selvanayagam Ravindar)

Group Update:

Kaelan Mikowicz
* Last week: Integrated the captcha sentence generator, and the labelling model into the server. Can now receive and test audio files live. Implemented GMM as an attempt at a model.
* This week: Write a script that tests the model, and produces metrics and graphs. Try to improve model and get a bigger dataset.
* Issues: Had trouble converting .ogg to .wav due to poor library implementation, but fixed it. Model is heavily dependent on microphone used

Andrei Blebea
* Last week: Wrote a script to generate an attack sound from individual words and a tts
* This week: Test attack and work on possible defenses.
* Issues: Need more words to generate sentences.
